A mobile first responsive web-page about making green energy affordable for people with average budget. The web-page will have nav-bar, masthead, main-content and footer. Nav-bar has 4 items: home, about, contact and blog. Masthead has to have a background image and a tag-line.

For main-content, you will have 3 buttons and 3 contents (your 3 solutions about making a clean energy affordable for majority of people) stored in an object. On the page load, the first content will be hard-coded HTML. This content will be replaced by another content from JavaScript object once a button is clicked. The first button (because it corresponds to the first content displayed on the page-load) will have a different style than other two (indicating active button). As user clicks any button, id "active-button" will move to the clicked button and corresponding content will be displayed. Size of images and fonts change with the screen-width. Break-point for responsive design will be at: 30rem. Max-width of content is 60rem. This means that content has to be centered in the view-port once 60rem of content-width is exceeded.
